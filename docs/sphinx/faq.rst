**How do I run the m2g pipeline?**

To install the pipeline on your computer see the `single node install page <http://m2g.io/sphinx/local_config.html>`_, and for instructions on how to run it head over to the basic usage page and follow the tutorial there.

**How do you assess the quality of your pipeline?**

We assess the performance of the pipeline after each algorithm implemented through quality assurance measures and report these values after execution. The entire pipeline has been validated through a metric called test-retest (TRT) reliability which ensures that graphs estimated from an individual over multiple scans are more similar to themselves than they are to those estimated from other subjects.

**How often is m2g updated?**

m2g undergoes regular updates. If you have a feature suggestion of bug fix, please let us know using the issues section of our Github repository and we'll do our best to roll it out as soon as we can.

.. **If I don't have computing resources, can I still use this tool?**

.. Absolutely. We have cloud services available in which you can upload your data and process it using  m2g on our cluster for free. Details on this service can be found on the cloud computing page.
