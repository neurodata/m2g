# Contributing to NDMG

This document is a working draft.  Edits and comments welcome.

## Driving Principles

1. Any code from NeuroData (eg, written based on work here, and therefore funded by our funders, rather than for fun), live in a neurodata controlled org, rather than a personal repo (much like if you worked at google or a startup).
2. Everything is always a PR, never a direct commit to master
3. People using the code should always use master, if you have some branch that you think is better than master for some reason, then it is your responsibility to make a PR to master, rather than encouraging other people to use some untested branch. that is, unless you want them to be testing for you, which is a different thing.

## Branch System


## Contributing through GitHub


## [Feature branches](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/feature-branch-workflow)
* Create a branch for each feature addition
* Each PR should ideally encapsulate a single feature.  This allows reviews to be well contained
* Donâ€™t let branches get stale (merge in changes from master frequently)
* Squash and merge each PR
* Keep the commit history clean and concise. Commit messages should be in [imperative mood](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/).

## Improvement Criteria


## Code formatting
* [Black](https://github.com/ambv/black) for Python
* Automatically apply formatting before commit (either format on save or format on commit)

#### Consider the following naming conventions (Python)
* [PascalCase](http://wiki.c2.com/?PascalCase) for class names
* descriptive_names_with_underscores for function and variable names
* singlename.py for module names
* ALL_CAPS_WITH_UNDERSCORES for constants
* _single_leading_underscore for protected methods / internal functions
* Docstring formatting: [NumPy style](https://sphinxcontrib-napoleon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/example_numpy.html)

## Issues
* An Issue should consist of a manageable task with a concrete DOD; larger tasks should be split into multiple issues, with milestones, epics, and or tags.
* Create an issue template.  Can use [these](https://github.com/neurodata/rerf/tree/staging/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE) as a guide.

## Testing
* Python: [Pytest](https://doc.pytest.org/)
* Code should have tests at the smallest function size possible (unit tests)
* Every new feature/Pull Request should have tests
* TravisCI integration
    * Each commit/branch/PR
* [Consider test-driven development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development)
