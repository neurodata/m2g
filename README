This project contains several tools to play with fiber data in
MRI Studio format [ http://www.mristudio.org/ ].

The python subdirectory contains the source code that generates
graphs from dMRI streamlines.  It produces two varieties of output:
  * smallgraphs: these use brain atlas regions of interest (70) to make 70z70 matrixes
  * biggraphs: these create connectivities among greymatter voxels.

The c directory contains legacy codes that is useless.
