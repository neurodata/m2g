Several utilities, written in python, to manipulate MR fiber data.

This code now generates small (70x70) graphs that are consistent with 
the output of the MRCAP pipeline.  It also generates large graphs that
have 400-600K non-zero entries.

To generate biggrgaphs versus smallgraphs on must change the import option on
gengraph.py and choose from
  from fibergraph import FiberGraph
  from fibergraph_sm import FiberGraph
  
This should be made a command line option.

Requirements:
  - Python packages:
    - numpy
    - scipy
  - If you want to handle large files...
    - lots of ram (> 8GB)
    - 64-bit python

*** fiber.py
    Module for reading MRI Studio-format fiber files

*** printfibers.py
    Simple script to echo a fiber file out as text

*** fibgergraph.py
*** fibgergraph_sm.py
    Module to represent the graph derived from an MRI studio file

*** gengraph.py
    Script to generate a graph on a single MRI studio file

*** generate.py
    Call gengraph.py on directories of MRI studio files

*** roislice.py
    Displays the regions of interest in the brain as 2-d projections

*** zindex.pyx
    The Morton-order space filling curve.  To get the coordinates of a large
    graph identifier call zindex.MortonXYZ ( id ) which returns [ x, y, z ].
    This is a cython optimized version of the code and needs to be installed
    into your python distribution by calling 'python setup.py install'

*** setup.py
    Install the zindex package into your python distribution
